# Bastter API

API developed to obtain data (Stocks, REITs, Ações and FIIs) from Bastter.com website.

The API is developed in order to obtain data, assist with investment studies and has no relation with the Bastter.com website.

## Bastter.com

Bastter.com is a web site with several information about investments in Brazil and Worldwide. Bastter.com has free and paid services. This API has no intention on providing illegal access to data from Bastter.com, therefore **in order to access paid data from Bastter.com it is required to provide login credentials.**

## Examples

In `examples` folder the main usage of the API is demonstrated.

## Development Stage

The API is in initial development stage with limited functionality and may remain like that for as long as I feel like :P
